Hi I'm Saila Rasheed! I am a college student and freelance designer, I love fashion, art, and playing around with graphic and UX design.
I consistently push myself to learn more about the types of design I am interested in and work on projects that are creative, fun and I am passionate about. 
I am currently looking to branch out of my career in UX Freelancing and collaborate with a business and design team,
I am super excited to meet new people and work on potential projects together!
